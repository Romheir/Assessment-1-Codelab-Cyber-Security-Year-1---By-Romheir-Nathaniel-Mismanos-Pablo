def hello (): 
    print("Hello") #this is the command needed to print "Hello"
def main():
    hello() #this calls the function "Hello"
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
#the output of this code would be "Hello"

#but for a more simplified version, simply doing: print ("Hello")

#or doing variable = Hello and doing: print (variable) also works to minimize and make the code more efficient.
